## My process

### Built with

- VScode
- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- [Custom Font](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Plus Jakarta Sans)
- CSS Box
- [Styled Components](https://github.com/WowCodeSusah/notifications-page-main/edit/main/styles) - For styles

### What I learned

i learned how to use span so that a paragragh can have multiple class in a sentence. I also learned how to box text and other objects to make things able to center.

```html
<div class="basetext"><span class="N">Notifications</span><span class="three">3</span></div>
      <div class="M">Mark all as read</div>
```
```css
.three {
    padding: 5px;
    background-color: hsl(219, 64%, 42%);
    color: white;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```
### Continued development

After doing this challenge i have now figured out that there is still a lot to learned about html and css also i must become faster in coding both languanges as i was unable to finish this challenge in time. For javascript i was unable to add any and i will further my knowledge in the future. 
### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to gain extra knowledge about code that i didnt understand beforehand.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an amazing website that helps answers questions that i was unable to answer.
